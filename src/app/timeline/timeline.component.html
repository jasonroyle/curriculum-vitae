  <h3>IntelliCentrics 2018 to present</h3>
  <p>
    With teams in Texas, Boston, Costa Rica, and the UK, building healthcare
    systems for the US, UK, China, and Taiwan, working at IntelliCentrics would
    prove to be a complete change of scale and pace. My full-stack skill set was
    immediately focused to take advantage of my Angular experience in my initial
    role as Senior Front-End Developer. As I worked closely with a UK-based team
    supporting the development of legacy Angular projects, the new micro-service
    platform was in early conception. The front-end codebase of the new platform
    uses the Nx monorepo build system with Angular - an architectural pattern
    that was new to me and so I was eager to get involved.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a brief detour from the typical stack, I setup a React Native project
    boilerplate in TypeScript, closely followed by the development of an
    application which was based on the boilerplate and was published to both the
    iOS App Store and Android Play Store.
  </p>
  <p>
    The UK-based Lead Front-End Developer and Lead Architect took me under their
    wings and aided my personal progression. In December 2019 we flew to the
    Texas office which was hosting a week long 'UI Summit' where each of the key
    front-end leaders would gather to formulate a detailed micro front-end
    library architecture to compliment the micro-service back-end and enable
    team structures based on each vertical slice of the platform. Around this
    time, I progressed to become one of two Lead Front-End Developers in the
    company. With direction from the Lead Architect I was tasked to build the
    PKCE authentication library, which every application has since implemented
    to authenticate users and authorise API access through the gateway. While I
    was still heavily involved with developing the codebase, I was also leading,
    mentoring and on-boarding for both UK and US-based teams.
  </p>
  <p>
    We developed some internal tools specifically for developers, product
    owners, quality auditors, and the user experience teams:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Training: providing teams with training resources, including tutorial
      videos, presentation slides, and practical exercises, each of which we had
      created ourselves.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sandbox: for each team to provide interactive proof-of-concept examples of
      their reusable components.
    </li>
    <li>
      Design system: providing thorough documentation and interactive examples
      of the foundational components.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I then took technical leadership of the UX team tasked with building
    foundational components, applying a strict open source style discipline to
    deliver semantically scoped feature sets and customisation, enabling
    developers to rapidly deliver contextual implementations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Following managerial changes of the company I have since become a Front-End
    Technical Lead, with responsibilities generally around sprint refinement and
    team mentoring, alongside ongoing work on improving the CI/CD pipelines,
    upgrades, architectural documentation, and any other front-end topics. Each
    week the technical leads host a meeting with all front-end developers to
    share any globally interesting updates and to give everyone the opportunity
    to highlight any issues or topics which are impacting them.

  <h3>Synextra 2015 to '18</h3>
  <p>
    I left Ingenium for an exciting opportunity to work for a startup company
    based in Trafford Park as their Lead Software Developer. Synextra is a cloud
    IT solutions company that provides their customers with virtual hosted
    desktops, internet, VoIP and bespoke dedicated server configurations with
    hosting in 2 major data centres. I took over development of an existing
    incident reporting system that was built for a client that owns a number of
    hospitals. There were many potential software customers and our own in-house
    systems to develop so I set about developing a boilerplate for all future
    applications. The boilerplate was written in TypeScript and has a NodeJS API
    and an Angular UI the boilerplate has many features baked in to it such as
    user / authentication management, file uploading and secure sharing,
    real-time notifications, message queues and an advanced tag and attributes
    system.
  </p>
  <p>
    The boilerplate has since powered many applications such as a helpline
    system for a charity that deals with the prevention of suicidal youths. This
    application collates SMS, email and call narratives per client in a thread
    with the ability to reply to the client, edit details of the client and add
    notes, outcomes and progression. All clients are anonymous to the Hopeline
    agent until there is a need to inform emergency services at which point the
    agent can reveal the client's contact information to pass on. This system
    uses sockets to inform the agent of real time events such as a queue of
    clients awaiting a response, clients assigned to other agents and other
    agents currently replying to a client.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have also used the boilerplate to begin development of our cloud customer
    portal. I have used a number of technologies and languages to do such things
    as provision servers and manage users in Active Directory. To combat
    scalability issues when dealing with a large amount of data or a potentially
    large amount of processes I have utilised message queues to maintain
    consistent control.

  <h3>Ingenium IDS 2007 to '15</h3>
  <p>
    My career began as a web developer for Ingenium IDS working alongside the
    Head of IT and Development. Ingenium hosted CPD approved events for public
    sector workplace management while building up a database of high level
    public sector contacts. My first roles in this employment included designing
    and making websites and email campaigns for each event and developing an
    order system that would track everything from purchase orders and sales to
    scanning attendee badges for reporting. My role at the events as Technical
    Support Manager included setup of reception laptops that connected
    wirelessly to our event server that hosted a local version of the order
    system, setup of presentation laptops and helping speakers with any
    last-minute alterations.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the company evolved I was promoted to Senior Web Developer and we
    developed a marketing system that would utilise the ever-growing public
    sector database to publicise our own events and saw an opportunity for a
    data-included public sector marketing tool. The company invested in 2 new
    members of the development team and a high end email campaign tool called
    PowerMTA and we started development of a system dubbed iServe that would
    later become the backbone to Ingenium. iServe enabled customers to query our
    database, import and query their own data, manage suppressions, send
    campaigns to query results, build dynamic surveys, track opens, clicks and
    forwards of sent campaigns and feedback with detailed and customisable
    reports. iServe gathered many highly regarded clients such as IBM, Oracle
    and Xerox. To publish iServe survey results and newly adopted online webinar
    events the company created a sub-brand titled iGov. I developed the iGov
    News website that hosts video presentations, survey results and public
    sector news articles. iServe continues it's development today and is capable
    of sending millions of emails each day.

  <p>
    I began web development as a hobby at the age of 15, teaching myself
    everything I needed to know to build engaging and interactive websites and
    forums. In 2007 I became employed as a web developer which soon became a
    career that I found creative and that I had a great passion for.
  </p>
  <p>
    I really enjoy the challenges and sense of fulfilment that software
    development provides. Keeping up-to-date with new technologies and processes
    to learn how they could help with current and up-coming projects increases
    my knowledge and skill set continuously. I strongly push for projects and
    their infrastructures to be efficient, scalable and intuitive to the best of
    my ability.
